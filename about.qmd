Welcome to my website!!

**About Me:**

I am Sherise Tan, a Year 2 Psychology Undergraduate taking the course of NM2207 this semester! I love listening to kpop, dancing and playing cozy games.

**Identified Dataset**

My identified data set is the Valentines Day Data Set provided by Suraj Das on Kaggle that can be accessed through the link below: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/infinator/happy-valentines-day-2022. This submitted data set takes data from the National Retail Foundation (NRF) Valentines Day Consumer Survey from 2010 to 2022. In 2022, NRF surveyed *7,728* US adult consumers that was conducted in *January 3-11* and has a margin of error of +/- 1.1 percentage points.

However, since the dataset provided on Kaggle is unclean, I will be referencing the cleaned-version as well on tidytuesday on Github as well: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-02-13/readme.md.

Notice that since this dataset only records data until 2022, the insights provided may not representative to current events. However, it still serves as useful as to how sentiment towards Valentines Day has changed over the course of many years.

**Data Cleaning & Selecting Data for Visualisations**

While most of the data used was derived from the cleaned data on Github, unclean gender-related sentiment data found on Kaggle needed to be used to provide a more comprehensive appraisal of shifts in attitudes towards Valentines Day. Hence, I converted the datasets stored as seperate csv files on Kaggle into excel sheets and manually cleaned the dataframes of its units, before reconverting back the csv files to be opened in Rstudio.

Besides cleaning, I also use the relevant commands to filter using the tidyverse package to isolate the data that I want to use for data visualisation like select(). I also had to rename a few columns to shorten the variable name.

**Choice of Data Visualisation**

My choices for data visualisations was heavily limited by the dataset provided. Since much of the data presented was trend related data across time or categories, I chose to use line charts to best demonstrate change across time and bar charts for changes across categories. As for some qualitative gendered sentiment, we felt that representing them in pie charts and stacked bar charts would allow for a clearer representation of the proportion of surveyors that agree with a certain sentiment.

As I wanted to make the webpage more interactive beyond just showing data, I went on to discover the billboarder package that allowed web-users to hover over each observation and allowed them to show and hide certain

**Choice of Narrative**

My choice of narrative for this data story is related to my choice of dataset. Prior to this project, I was worried about my ability to craft a story to integrate seamlessly into the data analysis. I have a background in psychology which meant that I was used to evaluating data and results rather than creating stories. Hence, to reduce the potential difficulty with crafting a narrative, I chose to find datasets that provided opportunities for trend related analysis and was of a topic that I was very interested. Eventually, I chose to use the Valentines Day Trends dataset as it corroborated with my interest in finding out how my expectations towards Valentines Day stood compared to the rest of society. Afterwards, crafting the narrative became easier because it was also trying to answer something I always wanted to know as well. I eventually chose the most recent romance debate on Tiktok on the Lau Pat Sat as it also just coincided with period prior to Valentines Day.

**R Techniques Used**

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=TRUE}
topics <- c("Course Introduction", "Intorduction to ggplot","Manipulating data", "Visualizing data - 1","Visualizing data - 2","Billboarder Package")
weeks <- c(1,2,4,7,8,"Self Taught")
topics_table <- data.frame(Topic= topics,Week = weeks)
print(topics_table)
```

Most of the techniques used can be found from previous weeks assignments. The billboarder package that allowed me the use of piecharts and stacked bar charts was easy to learn from online resources and guides as its data structure was similar to that of tidyverse package.

**Takeaways from the Module**

From this module, I have not only expanded my view on the perceived uses of Rstudio, but also have gained confidence in making my own personal projects with the use of coding.
