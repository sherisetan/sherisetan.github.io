    "text": "Two months ago, a girl took to TikTok to vent about her first date experience: being taken to Lau Pat Sat, a lively hawker centre nestled in the heart of the Central Business District. Little did she anticipate that her candid TikTok rant would ignite a controversy, with Singaporeans flooding the comments section to share their diverse perspectives on the expectations surrounding dates and partners. While some voiced criticism over her seemingly unrealistic expectations for first dates, citing the costliness of Lau Pat Sat and its decent food offerings, others stood in solidarity with her. They argued that taking her to a hawker centre suggested a lack of effort on the part of the gentleman to make a lasting impression.\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"/Users/sheriseses/Documents/Github/sherisetan.github.io/lps.png\")\n\n\n\n\nScreencap from Reddit\n\n\n\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"/Users/sheriseses/Documents/Github/sherisetan.github.io/Arguments.png\")\n\n\n\n\nScreencap from Tiktok About Opinions Towards the Controversy\n\n\n\n\nIn the midst of the whirlwind of debates surrounding romantic relationships, Valentine’s Day lingered heavily on people’s minds. With a myriad of expectations and societal norms in play, the question arose: How does one celebrate romantic relationships in a manner that avoids being labeled as “toxic” or raising “red flags”?\nIn this data-driven story, we delve into the insights provided by the National Retail Foundation’s Consumer Data Survey on Valentine’s Day from 2010 to 2022.\nThrough this dataset, we wish to answer the following questions:\n\nWhat are the spending trends related to Valentines Day\nWhat are the quantitative sentiments towards Valentines Day\nWhat are gender differences in sentiments towards Valentines Day ?\n\n \nWhat are the spending trends related to Valentines Day?\nAnswer: Expenditure is increasing overall from 2010 to 2022\n \nWhat are the quantitative sentiments towards Valentines Day\nAnswer: Although spending trends suggest an increase in celebration, the percentage of people actually celebrating the holiday is decreasing from 2010 to 2022 instead. We have also noted that young adults (Gen Z aged 18-25) have the most percentage of people celebrating this holiday and this observation decreases as the age groups increase. This could suggest that instead of associating with increased celebration, spending trends could be hinting to an increase in commercialisation of the holiday instead.\n \nWhat are gender differences in sentiments towards Valentines Day ?\nAnswer: Sentiments towards Valentines Day should not be taken towards homogenous across genders, as evident by the differing expectations towards Valentines Day. However, there seems to be attempts to level the paying field when it comes to Valentines Day, with women starting to take on responsibilities initially reserved for men on Valentines Day such as gift giving. Furthermore, men and women do not differ substantially on their alternative plans to mark the occasion despite not celebrating Valentines Day, which highlights a shift in gendered demands of Valentines Day, with men and women now facing relatively similar expectations.\nConclusion\nSo what is the takeaway? It seems that with the commercialisation of the holiday, people want to celebrate the holiday with their own terms and not be forced to conformed to societal standards. Men and women are also held to the similar expectations when it comes to Valentines although they maintain certain contrasting preferences. With this in mind, it seems that it is acceptable to celebrate however one wants as long as partners are agreeable and are held to similar expectations. After all, as much as people on Tiktok can give their own two cents, the focus on the celebration is still on the people in the relationship.\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"/Users/sheriseses/Documents/Github/sherisetan.github.io/hvd.png\")\n\n\n\n\nMade with Canva"

    "text": "Welcome to my website!!\n\n\n\nits me !\n\n\nAbout Me:\nI am Sherise Tan, a Year 2 Psychology Undergraduate taking the course of NM2207 this semester! I love listening to kpop and playing cozy games.\nIdentified Dataset\nMy identified data set is the Valentines Day Data Set provided by Suraj Das on Kaggle that can be accessed through the link below: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/infinator/happy-valentines-day-2022. This submitted data set takes data from the National Retail Foundation (NRF) Valentines Day Consumer Survey from 2010 to 2022. In 2022, NRF surveyed 7,728 US adult consumers that was conducted in January 3-11 and has a margin of error of +/- 1.1 percentage points.\nHowever, since the dataset provided on Kaggle is unclean, I will be referencing the cleaned-version as well on tidytuesday on Github as well: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-02-13/readme.md.\nNotice that since this dataset only records data until 2022, the insights provided may not representative to current events. However, it still serves as useful as to how sentiment towards Valentines Day has changed over the course of many years.\nData Cleaning & Selecting Data for Visualisations\nWhile most of the data used was derived from the cleaned data on Github, unclean gender-related sentiment data found on Kaggle needed to be used to provide a more holistic attitude towards shift in attitudes towards Valentines Day. Hence, I converted the datasets stored as seperate csv files on Kaggle into excel sheets and manually cleaned the dataframes of its units, before reconverting back the csv files to be opened in Rstudio.\nBesides cleaning, I also use the relevant functions to filter data using the tidyverse package to isolate the data that I want to use for data visualisation such as select(), rename etc\nChoice of Data Visualisation\nMy choices for data visualisations was heavily limited by the dataset provided. Since much of the data presented was trend related data across time or categories, I chose to use line charts to best demonstrate change across time and bar charts for changes across categories. As for some qualitative gendered sentiment, we felt that representing them in pie charts and stacked bar charts would allow for a clearer representation of the proportion of surveyors that agree with a certain sentiment.\nAs I wanted to make the webpage more interactive beyond just showing data, I went on to discover the billboarder package that allowed web-users to hover over each observation and allowed them to show and hide certain\nChoice of Narrative\nMy choice of narrative for this data story is related to my choice of dataset. Prior to this project, I was worried about my ability to craft a story to integrate seamlessly into the data analysis. I have a background in psychology which meant that I was used to evaluating data and results rather than creating stories. Hence, to reduce the potential difficulty with crafting a narrative, I chose to find datasets that provided opportunities for trend related analysis and was of a topic that I was very interested. Eventually, I chose to use the Valentines Day Trends dataset as it corroborated with my interest in finding out how my expectations towards Valentines Day stood compared to the rest of society. Afterwards, crafting the narrative became easier because it was also trying to answer something I always wanted to know as well. I eventually chose the most recent romance debate on Tiktok on the Lau Pat Sat\nCitations Used (APA)\nChang, E. (2020, February 12). Valentine’s day 2020: How much money will be spent?
