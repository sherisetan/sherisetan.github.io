    "text": "Two months ago, a girl took to TikTok to vent about her first date experience: being taken to Lau Pat Sat, a lively hawker centre nestled in the heart of the Central Business District. Little did she anticipate that her candid TikTok rant would ignite a controversy, with Singaporeans flooding the comments section to share their diverse perspectives on the expectations surrounding dates and partners. While some voiced criticism over her seemingly unrealistic expectations for first dates, citing the costliness of Lau Pat Sat and its decent food offerings, others stood in solidarity with her. They argued that taking her to a hawker centre suggested a lack of effort on the part of the gentleman to make a lasting impression.\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"/Users/sheriseses/Documents/Github/sherisetan.github.io/lps.png\")\n\n\n\n\nScreencap from Reddit\n\n\n\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"/Users/sheriseses/Documents/Github/sherisetan.github.io/Arguments.png\")\n\n\n\n\nScreencap from Tiktok About Opinions Towards the Controversy\n\n\n\n\nIn the midst of the whirlwind of debates surrounding romantic relationships, Valentine’s Day lingered heavily on people’s minds. With a myriad of expectations and societal norms in play, the question arose: How does one celebrate romantic relationships in a manner that avoids being labeled as “toxic” or raising “red flags”?\nIn this data-driven story, we delve into the insights provided by the National Retail Foundation’s Consumer Data Survey on Valentine’s Day from 2010 to 2022. By examining spending trends, we aim to shed light on how perceptions and sentiments towards Valentine’s Day have evolved over the years and how couples can use these sentiments as a guide to spending a memorable Valentines Day.\n \n \n \nSo what is the takeaway? It seems that despite the overall increase in Valentines Day Expenditure, lesser people are celebrating the holiday in general. While there are some general norms of what one should get for Valentines Day, there are others who have chose to deviate from the norm and celebrate Valentines Day on their own terms. Hence, whatever way you choose to celebrate the holdiay, as long as you and your partner are agreeable and are both enjoying the celebration, feel free to run wild. After all, who cares about what people on Tiktok think, when the relationship is about the 2 of you."
