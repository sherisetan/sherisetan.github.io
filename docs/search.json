    "text": "Two months ago, a girl took to TikTok to vent about her first date experience: being taken to Lau Pat Sat, a lively hawker centre nestled in the heart of the Central Business District. Little did she anticipate that her candid TikTok rant would ignite a controversy, with Singaporeans flooding the comments section to share their diverse perspectives on the expectations surrounding dates and partners. While some voiced criticism over her seemingly unrealistic expectations for first dates, citing the costliness of Lau Pat Sat and its decent food offerings, others stood in solidarity with her. They argued that taking her to a hawker centre suggested a lack of effort on the part of the gentleman to make a lasting impression.\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"/Users/sheriseses/Documents/Github/sherisetan.github.io/lps.png\")\n\n\n\n\nScreencap from Reddit\n\n\n\n\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"/Users/sheriseses/Documents/Github/sherisetan.github.io/Arguments.png\")\n\n\n\n\nScreencap from Tiktok About Opinions Towards the Controversy\n\n\n\n\nIn the midst of the whirlwind of debates surrounding romantic relationships, Valentine’s Day lingered heavily on people’s minds. With a myriad of expectations and societal norms in play, the question arose: How does one celebrate romantic relationships in a manner that avoids being labeled as “toxic” or raising “red flags”?\nIn this data-driven story, we delve into the insights provided by the National Retail Foundation’s Consumer Data Survey on Valentine’s Day from 2010 to 2022.\nThrough this dataset, we wish to answer the following questions:\n\nWhat are the spending trends related to Valentines Day\nWhat are the quantitative sentiments towards Valentines Day\nWhat are gender differences in sentiments towards Valentines Day ?\n\n \nWhat are the spending trends related to Valentines Day?\nExpenditure is increasing overall from 2010 to 2022. A peak is observed not because of a spurge in spendings but merely cause of the economic ramifications from Covid 19 from 2020 to 2021. However, spending trends seem to be increasing again from 2021 to 2022.\n \nWhat are the quantitative sentiments towards Valentines Day\nAlthough spending trends suggest an increase in celebration, the percentage of people actually celebrating the holiday is decreasing from 2010 to 2022 instead. This could suggest that instead of associating with increased celebration, spending trends could be hinting to an increase in commercialisation of the holiday, causing prices for Valentines Day related items to rise.\nWe have also noted that young adults (Gen Z aged 18-25) have the most percentage of people celebrating this holiday and this observation decreases as the age groups increase. However, this could be attributed to the broadening definitions of Valentines Day than increased in emphasis on romantic relationships.\n \nWhat are gender differences in sentiments towards Valentines Day ?\nSentiments towards Valentines Day should not be taken towards homogenous across genders, as evident by the differing expectations towards Valentines Day.\nHowever, there seems to be attempts to level the paying field when it comes to Valentines Day, with women starting to take on responsibilities initially reserved for men on Valentines Day such as gift giving. Furthermore, men and women do not differ substantially on their alternative plans to mark the occasion despite not celebrating Valentines Day, which highlights a shift in gendered demands of Valentines Day, with men and women now facing relatively similar expectations.\nWhat’s the takeaway?\nJust like the infamous “Lau Pat Sat” girl, many people are prone to having an overly romanticised view on how romantic relationships and how romantic celebrations work. Due to the advent rise of romantic movie media, this has warped our perceptions and satisfaction of real life relationships (Ray, 2022). Furthermore, the popularity of social media usage has caused us to be more prone to comparisons and unrealistic expectations from viewing performative posts on love (Schmanske, 2018). Hence, based on spending trends and the percentage of people celebrating, we can see that there are people who are willing to pay more for Valentines Day to meet such fantasy’s of Valentines Day. However, based on sentiment data, we can tell that there is a trend where people are trying to move away from this media imposed expectations of relationships as there as lesser people celebrating it and men and women are sharing similar burdens and expectations towards Valentines Day.\nTherefore, we can conclude that increased expenditure may not always equate to more love between couples. Instead of trying to follow the popular way of celebrating Valentines Day, we should focus on what truly matters in the relationship, even if its not about materialistic possessions but quality time. So go on and celebrate Valentines Day on your own terms! After all, Valentines Day is just a day, there are many ways of expressing affection love besides doing so on this specific day❣️\n\nknitr::include_graphics(\"/Users/sheriseses/Documents/Github/sherisetan.github.io/hvd.png\")\n\n\n\n\nMade with Canva"

    "text": "Welcome to my website!!\n\n\n\nits me !\n\n\nAbout Me:\nI am Sherise Tan, a Year 2 Psychology Undergraduate taking the course of NM2207 this semester! I love listening to kpop, dancing and playing cozy games.\nIdentified Dataset\nMy identified data set is the Valentines Day Data Set provided by Suraj Das on Kaggle that can be accessed through the link below: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/infinator/happy-valentines-day-2022. This submitted data set takes data from the National Retail Foundation (NRF) Valentines Day Consumer Survey from 2010 to 2022. In 2022, NRF surveyed 7,728 US adult consumers that was conducted in January 3-11 and has a margin of error of +/- 1.1 percentage points.\nHowever, since the dataset provided on Kaggle is unclean, I will be referencing the cleaned-version as well on tidytuesday on Github as well: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-02-13/readme.md.\nNotice that since this dataset only records data until 2022, the insights provided may not representative to current events. However, it still serves as useful as to how sentiment towards Valentines Day has changed over the course of many years.\nData Cleaning & Selecting Data for Visualisations\nWhile most of the data used was derived from the cleaned data on Github, unclean gender-related sentiment data found on Kaggle needed to be used to provide a more holistic attitude towards shift in attitudes towards Valentines Day. Hence, I converted the datasets stored as seperate csv files on Kaggle into excel sheets and manually cleaned the dataframes of its units, before reconverting back the csv files to be opened in Rstudio.\nBesides cleaning, I also use the relevant functions to filter data using the tidyverse package to isolate the data that I want to use for data visualisation such as select(), rename etc\nChoice of Data Visualisation\nMy choices for data visualisations was heavily limited by the dataset provided. Since much of the data presented was trend related data across time or categories, I chose to use line charts to best demonstrate change across time and bar charts for changes across categories. As for some qualitative gendered sentiment, we felt that representing them in pie charts and stacked bar charts would allow for a clearer representation of the proportion of surveyors that agree with a certain sentiment.\nAs I wanted to make the webpage more interactive beyond just showing data, I went on to discover the billboarder package that allowed web-users to hover over each observation and allowed them to show and hide certain\nChoice of Narrative\nMy choice of narrative for this data story is related to my choice of dataset. Prior to this project, I was worried about my ability to craft a story to integrate seamlessly into the data analysis. I have a background in psychology which meant that I was used to evaluating data and results rather than creating stories. Hence, to reduce the potential difficulty with crafting a narrative, I chose to find datasets that provided opportunities for trend related analysis and was of a topic that I was very interested. Eventually, I chose to use the Valentines Day Trends dataset as it corroborated with my interest in finding out how my expectations towards Valentines Day stood compared to the rest of society. Afterwards, crafting the narrative became easier because it was also trying to answer something I always wanted to know as well. I eventually chose the most recent romance debate on Tiktok on the Lau Pat Sat as it also just coincided with period prior to Valentines Day.\nR Techniques Used\n\ntopics &lt;- c(\"Course Introduction\", \"Intorduction to ggplot\",\"Manipulating data\", \"Visualizing data - 1\",\"Visualizing data - 2\",\"Billboarder Package\")\nweeks &lt;- c(1,2,4,7,8,\"Self Taught\")\ntopics_table &lt;- data.frame(Topic= topics,Week = weeks)\nprint(topics_table)\n\n                   Topic        Week\n1    Course Introduction           1\n2 Intorduction to ggplot           2\n3      Manipulating data           4\n4   Visualizing data - 1           7\n5   Visualizing data - 2           8\n6    Billboarder Package Self Taught\n\n\nMost of the techniques used can be found from previous weeks assignments. The billboarder package that allowed me the use of piecharts and stacked bar charts was easy to learn from online resources and guides as its data structure was similar to that of tidyverse package.\nTakeaways from the Module\nFrom this module, I have not only expanded my view on the perceived uses of Rstudio, but also have gained confidence in making my own personal projects with the use of coding.\nCitations Used (APA)\nFerguson, D.
