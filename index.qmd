Two months ago, a girl took to TikTok to vent about her first date experience: being taken to Lau Pat Sat, a lively hawker centre nestled in the heart of the Central Business District. Little did she anticipate that her candid TikTok rant would ignite a controversy, with Singaporeans flooding the comments section to share their diverse perspectives on the expectations surrounding dates and partners. While some voiced criticism over her seemingly unrealistic expectations for first dates, citing the costliness of Lau Pat Sat and its decent food offerings, others stood in solidarity with her. They argued that taking her to a hawker centre suggested a lack of effort on the part of the gentleman to make a lasting impression.

In the midst of the whirlwind of debates surrounding romantic relationships, Valentine's Day lingered heavily on people's minds. With a myriad of expectations and societal norms in play, the question arose: How does one celebrate romantic relationships in a manner that avoids being labeled as "toxic" or raising "red flags"?

In this data-driven story, we delve into the insights provided by the National Retail Foundation's Consumer Data Survey on Valentine's Day from 2010 to 2022.

Through this dataset, we wish to answer the following questions:

1.  **What are the spending trends related to Valentines Day**
2.  **What are the quantitative sentiments towards Valentines Day**
3.  **What are gender differences in sentiments towards Valentines Day ?**

**What are the spending trends related to Valentines Day?**

Expenditure is increasing overall from 2010 to 2022. A peak is observed not because of a spurge in spendings but merely cause of the economic ramifications from Covid 19 from 2020 to 2021. However, spending trends seem to be increasing again from 2021 to 2022.

```
**What are the quantitative sentiments towards Valentines Day**

Although spending trends suggest an increase in celebration, the percentage of people actually celebrating the holiday is decreasing from 2010 to 2022 instead. This could suggest that instead of associating with increased celebration, spending trends could be hinting to an increase in commercialisation of the holiday, causing prices for Valentines Day related items to rise.

We have also noted that young adults (Gen Z aged 18-25) have the most percentage of people celebrating this holiday and this observation decreases as the age groups increase. However, this could be attributed to the broadening definitions of Valentines Day than increased in emphasis on romantic relationships.

```
**What are gender differences in sentiments towards Valentines Day ?**

Sentiments towards Valentines Day should not be taken towards homogenous across genders, as evident by the differing expectations towards Valentines Day.

However, there seems to be attempts to level the paying field when it comes to Valentines Day, with women starting to take on responsibilities initially reserved for men on Valentines Day such as gift giving. Furthermore, men and women do not differ substantially on their alternative plans to mark the occasion despite not celebrating Valentines Day, which highlights a shift in gendered demands of Valentines Day, with men and women now facing relatively similar expectations.

**What's the takeaway?**

Just like the infamous "Lau Pat Sat" girl, many people are prone to having an overly romanticised view on how romantic relationships and how romantic celebrations work. Due to the **advent rise of romantic movie media**, this has warped our perceptions and satisfaction of real life relationships (Ray, 2022). Furthermore, the popularity of **social media** usage has caused us to be more **prone to comparisons and unrealistic expectations** from viewing performative posts on love (Schmanske, 2018). Hence, based on spending trends and the percentage of people celebrating, we can see that there are people who are willing to pay more for Valentines Day to meet such fantasy's of Valentines Day. However, based on sentiment data, we can tell that there is a trend where people are trying to move away from this media imposed expectations of relationships as there as lesser people celebrating it and men and women are sharing similar burdens and expectations towards Valentines Day.

Therefore, we can conclude that increased expenditure may not always equate to more love between couples. Instead of trying to follow the popular way of celebrating Valentines Day, we should focus on what truly matters in the relationship, even if its not about materialistic possessions but quality time. So go on and celebrate Valentines Day on your own terms! After all, Valentines Day is just a day, there are many ways of expressing affection love besides doing so on this specific day❣️
