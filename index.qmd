title: "How do spending trends showcase the shifting attitudes towards Valentinesâ€™s Day over the years?"

Two months ago, a girl took to TikTok to vent about her first date experience: being taken to Lau Pat Sat, a lively hawker centre nestled in the heart of the Central Business District. Little did she anticipate that her candid TikTok rant would ignite a controversy, with Singaporeans flooding the comments section to share their diverse perspectives on the expectations surrounding dates and partners. While some voiced criticism over her seemingly unrealistic expectations for first dates, citing the costliness of Lau Pat Sat and its decent food offerings, others stood in solidarity with her. They argued that taking her to a hawker centre suggested a lack of effort on the part of the gentleman to make a lasting impression.

In the midst of the whirlwind of debates surrounding romantic relationships, Valentine's Day lingered heavily on people's minds. With a myriad of expectations and societal norms in play, the question arose: How does one celebrate romantic relationships in a manner that avoids being labeled as "toxic" or raising "red flags"?

In this data-driven story, we delve into the insights provided by the National Retail Foundation's Consumer Data Survey on Valentine's Day from 2010 to 2022.

Through this dataset, we wish to answer the following questions:

1.  **What are the spending trends related to Valentines Day**
2.  **What are the quantitative sentiments towards Valentines Day**
3.  **What are gender differences in sentiments towards Valentines Day ?**

**What are the quantitative sentiments towards Valentines Day**

Answer: Although spending trends suggest an increase in celebration, the percentage of people actually celebrating the holiday is decreasing from 2010 to 2022 instead. We have also noted that young adults (Gen Z aged 18-25) have the most percentage of people celebrating this holiday and this observation decreases as the age groups increase. This could suggest that instead of associating with increased celebration, spending trends could be hinting to an increase in commercialisation of the holiday instead.

**What are gender differences in sentiments towards Valentines Day ?**

Answer: Sentiments towards Valentines Day should not be taken towards homogenous across genders, as evident by the differing expectations towards Valentines Day. However, there seems to be attempts to level the paying field when it comes to Valentines Day, with women starting to take on responsibilities initially reserved for men on Valentines Day such as gift giving. Furthermore, men and women do not differ substantially on their alternative plans to mark the occasion despite not celebrating Valentines Day, which highlights a shift in gendered demands of Valentines Day, with men and women now facing relatively similar expectations.

**Conclusion**

So what is the takeaway? It seems that with the commercialisation of the holiday, people want to celebrate the holiday with their own terms and not be forced to conformed to societal standards. Men and women are also held to the similar expectations when it comes to Valentines although they maintain certain contrasting preferences. With this in mind, it seems that it is acceptable to celebrate however one wants as long as partners are agreeable and are held to similar expectations. After all, as much as people on Tiktok can give their own two cents, the focus on the celebration is still on the people in the relationship.
